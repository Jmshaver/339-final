      <h1>Triwizard Cup</h1>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The Triwizard Tournament was one of the most exciting and challenging
          events I ever participated in during my time at Hogwarts. I was
          selected as the Hogwarts champion, along with champions from two other
          wizarding schools - Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons and Cedric Diggory
          from Hogwarts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tournament was filled with dangerous and thrilling tasks. The
          first task involved facing a Hungarian Horntail dragon and retrieving
          a golden egg. It was terrifying, but I managed to come out on top with
          the help of my trusty Firebolt broomstick.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second task was even more daunting - we had to rescue hostages
          from the depths of the Black Lake. I was worried about how I would
          breathe underwater, but luckily, my friend Ron had given me a special
          potion that helped me breathe like a fish. With the help of my friends
          and some clever thinking, I was able to rescue the hostages and make
          it back to the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final task was held in a maze, and it was the most intense one of
          all. We had to make our way through the maze, facing obstacles and
          challenges along the way. I was determined to win, but I faced a
          difficult choice near the end of the maze. Cedric and I both reached
          the Triwizard Cup at the same time, but it turned out to be a Portkey
          that transported us to a graveyard where we were confronted by the
          evil Lord Voldemort.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Triwizard Tournament turned out to be much more dangerous than I
          ever imagined. Cedric was tragically killed by Voldemort, and I was
          forced to face him in a terrifying duel. But I didn't give up, and
          with the help of my friends, I was able to escape and return to
          Hogwarts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Triwizard Tournament was a harrowing experience, but it taught me
          a lot about myself and the importance of friendship and loyalty. I'll
          never forget the challenges I faced during that tournament, and the
          friends I made along the way.
